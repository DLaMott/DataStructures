# DataStructures, algortihms, and programming fundamentals in Java

This repo's main purporse is to be a tool to aid Developers in need of study by example. This repo will highlight data structures, algorithms, and sorting techniques. This repo will over time also contain links to useful resources to better learn Java and or programming techniques.

Currently following along with the ***DataStructures and Algorithms in Java*** Book.
- Find the book here: [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-2nd/dp/0672324539/ref=asc_df_0672324539/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312060980065&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7650009611556419964&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9009548&hvtargid=pla-435322317838&psc=1)

This repo will lay out the data structures and Algorithims showcased throughout the book.
This will be updated as I study the book. Essentially after completing the book I will provide
additional sources to this repo. For now the next addition will be ***Cracking the code interview***

If others know of any other great reads on data structures and algorithms please feel free to add them!
## Resources can be:
- Books
- Youtube videos
- Articles
- Interview questions with soltuions

## To do:
- Complete chapters and post completed problems within repo
- Add Cracking the code interview chapters
- Follow up with other great ***Java*** resources
