Binary tree is a tree type non-linear data structure that are mainly used for sorting and searching because they store data in hierarchical form. In this section, we will learn the implementation of binary tree data structure in Java. Also, provides a short description of binary tree data structure.

Binary Tree:
A tree in which each node (parent) has at most two-child nodes (left and right) is called binary tree. The top most node is called the root node. In a binary tree a node contains the data and the pointer (address) of the left and right child node.

The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest (deepest) leaf. If the tree is empty, the height is 0. The height of the node is denoted by h.


We can calculate the number of leaves and node by using the following formula.

Maximum number of leaf nodes is a binary tree: 2h
Maximum number of nodes is a binary tree: 2h+1-1
Where, h is the height of binary tree.
